          Situated in a peaceful seaside village, Lavender & Lime is the perfect
          place to chillax with a cup of coffee, hot chocolate or milkshake,
          depending on the season.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also on the premises are many beautiful and practical plants for your
          garden and to brighten up your home. Decor is never really complete
          without some indoor plants, and who doesn&apos;t enjoy a walk in the
          garden in the cool of a summer evening.

        <h3 class="clear-div">Let us introduce our tree!</h3>
        <p>Scientific name: Phytolacca Dioica (Phytolaccaceae)</p>
        <p>Common name: Belhambra</p>

        <p>Alternative common names</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monkey grape, Ombu, Poke berry, Umbra Tree (English)</li>
          <li>Belambraboom, Dikboom, Bobbejaandruifboom (Afrikaans)</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>How does it spread?</h3>
        <p>It spreads by seed dispersal</p>

        <h3>The Tree</h3>
        <p>
          It competes with indigenous species. Due to its large size, even a
          single tree could have a significant effect on a natural ecosystem. In
          urban areas, seedlings often germinate along fence lines or walls and
          can cause considerable damage to property if they are allowed to grow
          to tree size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indigenous birds could neglest the dispersal of indegenous plants as a
          consequence of their preference for the fruits of this alien species.
          It has an umbrella like canopy and its trunk can have a girth of up to
          15m and can grow 12-19m high.
        </p>
        <p>
          P. Dioica&apos;s massive, fire resistant trunk contains water storage
          tissue, an excellent adaptation against the intense grassland fires
          common in the South American region. The sap of the tree is poisonous
          and not browsed by cattle. The leaves can be used as a laxative.

          Welcome to our friendly and tranquil atmosphere. Well-behaved,
          well-controlled pets, who are also well-socialised with other animals,

        <p>
          Talking of animals, sometimes they can give us a lesson in life, as in

            It is best to face a challenge head on, even when it seems really
            scary at the time.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is a good idea for some of the bigger, stronger ones among us, to
            tackle the problem that cannot be faced alone, especially by the
            smaller or younger ones. Some might be physically stronger,
            emotionally stronger or spiritually stronger.
          </li>
          <li>
            Safety is not so much in numbers alone, as it is in caring for and
            helping each other; standing up for each other

        <h5>Note:</h5>
        <p>
          There are many, many plants in stock which change with the seasons.
          Instead of a product list for both coffee shop and nursery, this site
          contains a product list for the coffee shop and an article about the
          historical tree, which was chopped down recently, for the nursery. The
          roots had already started pushing and damaging low brick walls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to visit us, to see for yourself, the lovely array of
          plants, flowers, shrubs and young trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if there is something you really want, and we do not have it, we
          will do our best to source it for you, if it is, in fact, feasible to
          grow said plant in your envisaged environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gardening and plant care advice is free with each visit and a smile is
          always free, wherever we are.
